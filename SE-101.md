## Error Code SE-101
> The '{name}' script is set to run each round, but the script is not found! [Error Code: SE-101]

This error occurs when a script is specified to run automatically in the `auto_run_scripts` Exiled config, but the script cannot be found in the Scripted Events directory. This may either be due to a typo in the config, in the script name, or if the script doesn't exist. This error can be resolved by resolving any typos in the script name, by creating a script that doesn't exist, or by deleting a non-existent script from the config option.
