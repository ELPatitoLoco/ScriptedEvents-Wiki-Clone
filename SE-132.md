## Error Code SE-132
>  The provided value '{input}' is not a valid variable. [Error Code: SE-132]

This error occurs when a variable requires another variable as an argument, but that other variable is not a valid variable. This error can be resolved by providing a valid variable.

The following script will generate SE-132, because `ABCDEF` is not a valid variable.
```
SAVE {MYPLAYERS} {LEN:ABCDEF}
```
