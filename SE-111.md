## Error Code SE-111
> Error in 'On' handler (event: {eventName}): Script '{script}' cannot be found! [Error Code: SE-111]

This error occurs when a script is present in the `on` Exiled config that is not present in the Scripted Events directory. This may either be due to a typo in the config, in the script name, or if the script doesn't exist. This error can be resolved by resolving any typos in the script name, by creating a script that doesn't exist, or by deleting a non-existent script from the config option.
