`NULL` is a placeholder action that serves no functionality. It is used to fill in a blank line and keep the amount of lines interpreted by the script consistent with the actual amount of lines in the file. It is automatically added to the script in place of every blank line or comment line. If added manually to a script, it serves zero functionality.

## Usage
```
NULL
