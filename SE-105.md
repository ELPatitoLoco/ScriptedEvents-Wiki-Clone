## Error Code SE-105
> The '{name}' script is set to run each round, but the script is marked as an admin event! [Error Code: SE-105]

This error occurs when a script is specified to run automatically in the `auto_run_scripts` Exiled config, but the script is marked as an admin event via the `!-- ADMINEVENT` flag. Admin event scripts are not meant to be run automatically. This error can be resolved by removing the script from the `auto_run_scripts` config, or removing the `!-- ADMINEVENT` flag from the script.
