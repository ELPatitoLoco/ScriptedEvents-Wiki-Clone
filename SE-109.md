## Error Code SE-109
> The '{eventName}' event is not currently compatible with the On config. [Error Code: SE-109]

This error occurs when an unsupported event is present in the `on` Exiled config. Unfortunately, there isn't much of a solution here at the moment. Due to how the system works, events must have an event argument in order to be usable with the `on` config. 99% of Exiled's events DO have an event argument, but very few of them do not. These are the unsupported events.

Maybe this error will be forever gone in the future!
