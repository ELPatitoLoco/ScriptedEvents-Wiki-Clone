## Error Code SE-113
> Script '{scriptName}' exceeded safety limit of {maxActionsLimit} actions per 1 second and has been force-stopped, saving from a potential crash. If this is intentional, add '!-- NOSAFETY' to the top of the script. All script loops should have a delay in them. [Error Code: SE-113]

This error occurs when a script executes more actions in 1 second than what is allowed in the Exiled configs, per the `max_actions_per_second` configuration. This is likely an indicator that the script is trying to do too much at one time, and could be due to a loop without a yield. This error can be resolved by performing less actions per second, and adding delays (such as `WAITSEC`) where they wont cause issues. Additionally, the `max_actions_per_second` config can be raised, allowing more actions to occur per-second. Lastly, as a last-case resort, adding the `!-- NOSAFETY` flag to the top of a script disables this warning for that individual script.
