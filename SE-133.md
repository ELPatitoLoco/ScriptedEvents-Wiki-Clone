## Error Code SE-133
>  The provided value '{input}' has no associated players. [Error Code: SE-133]

This error occurs when a variable requires another player variable as an argument, but the other variable is not a variable that contains players. This error can be resolved by providing a valid variable that contains players.

The following script will generate SE-133. Although `WARHEADDETONATED` is a valid variable, it does not contain any players.
```
SAVE {MYPLAYERS} {LEN:WARHEADDETONATED}
```
