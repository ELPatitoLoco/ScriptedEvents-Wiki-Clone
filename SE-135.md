## Error Code SE-135
>  The provided index '{index}' is greater than the size of the player collection. [Error Code: SE-135]

This error only occurs in the **{INDEXVAR}** variable. It occurs when the index provided is larger than the list it is trying to index. As an example, this error will occur if you try to get the 5th player from a variable containing only two players.
