## Error Code SE-131
>  The provided value '{input}' is not a valid variable or has no associated players. [Error Code: SE-131]

This error occurs when a variable requires another player variable as an argument, but that other variable is not a valid variable. This error will also occur if the variable is valid, but is not a variable that contains players. This error can be resolved by providing a valid variable that contains players.

The following script will generate SE-131, because `ABCDEF` is not a valid variable.
```
SAVE {MYPLAYERS} {FILTER:ABCDEF:ROLE:ClassD}
```

The following script will generate SE-131. Although `WARHEADDETONATED` is a valid variable, it does not contain any players.
```
SAVE {MYPLAYERS} {FILTER:WARHEADDETONATED:ROLE:ClassD}
```
