## Error Code SE-131
>  The provided value '{input}' is not a valid variable or has no associated players. [Error Code: SE-131]

This error occurs when a variable requires another variable as an argument, but that other variable is not a valid variable. This error can be resolved by providing a valid variable.

The following script will generate SE-131, because `ABCDEF` is not a valid variable.
```
SAVE {MYPLAYERS} {FILTER:ABCDEF:ROLE:ClassD}
```
