## Error Code SE-129
> Custom command '{commandName}' ({commandName}) will not be created because it is set to run zero scripts. [Error Code: SE-129]

This error occurs when there is a command specified in the `commands` Exiled config, but its `run` parameter is non-existent or empty. Custom commands must have at least one script set to run in order for the command to be created. As such, this error can be resolved by adding a script to run when the command is executed, or by removing the unfinished command structure from the config.
