## Error SE-100
> The '{name}' script is set to run each round, but the script is disabled! [Error Code: SE-100]

This error occurs when a disabled script is located in the `auto_run_scripts` config of the plugin's configuration options. In order to resolve this error, the script should be removed from the `auto_run_scripts` config, or it should be re-enabled by removing the `!-- DISABLED` flag from the script.
