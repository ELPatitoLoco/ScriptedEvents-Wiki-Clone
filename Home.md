# ScriptedEvents Wiki
Welcome to the ScriptedEvents wiki! This wiki covers every action and every feature of ScriptedEvents, and how they can be used to make automated and semi-automated events for your server.

ScriptedEvents has two main uses:
* Automation - Enables your server to have unique, per-round events, such as custom blackouts, custom automatic warhead, etc. You can make what you can think of!
* Semi-automated events - Enables your server to have unique admin events, such as a "hide and seek" game where you can define the rules!
