## Error Code SE-114
> Unable to create the help file, the plugin does not have permission to access the ScriptedEvents directory! [Error Code: SE-114]

This error occurs when the `HELP` action is executed, however, ScriptedEvents is unable to create the documentation file due to an unauthorized permission error (likely due to the PC or server machine's own antivirus software). This error can be resolved by adjusting the system's settings to allow Scripted Events to write files, or by using the `NOFILE` argument in the `HELP` action.
