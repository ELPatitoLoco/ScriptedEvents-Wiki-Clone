The `SILENTCASSIE` action grants CASSIE control in a script.

## Usage
```
SILENTCASSIE <MESSAGE>
```
Adds a silent CASSIE message.

## Arguments
### Message
The message to announce. [Variables](https://github.com/Thundermaker300/ScriptedEvents/wiki/Variables) can be used here. Optionally, splitting the text by using a `|` will announce the first half of the text as a CASSIE message and use the second half as CASSIE's caption text. If the second half has no text, captions will be disabled. See samples below.

See [https://github.com/Thundermaker300/ScriptedEvents/wiki/CASSIE](the CASSIE page) for samples of this command.
