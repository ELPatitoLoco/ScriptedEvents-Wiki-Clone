ScriptedEvents supports a wide range of conditions & condition variables, specifically in the [STOPIF](https://github.com/Thundermaker300/ScriptedEvents/wiki/STOPIF) and [WAITUNTIL](https://github.com/Thundermaker300/ScriptedEvents/wiki/WAITUNTIL) actions. These conditions allow for simple operations in order to yield or completely cancel a script if certain conditions are not met.
